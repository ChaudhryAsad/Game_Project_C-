# Game_Project_C++

## Introduction

For the course C++, we could choose if we wanted to make a game or an assignment. Because I like to turn theory into practice, I choose to design a game called ‘Snake’. 
At first I couldn’t choose between this game and Tetris. These are both very different to design. The reason I choose for ‘Snake’ is because this was technically the most challenging to do. I feel like you have to raise the bar for yourself in order to really understand the theory behind it. 
First I analyzed how the game exactly worked. With this information, I created the game in a minimalistic way to be sure that I would completely understand it. After that I elaborated it in detail. This was challenging, but I tried searching as much information as possible on the internet.
I had fun creating this game, and I hope you will enjoy it too! Below you will find the game details.
